          Every Saturday morning, we run on the part of the Bay trail near
          downtown San Mateo. We meet in Seal Point Park near the green marker
          on the map listed below - come rain or shine. We welcome all paces and
          walkers as well. Non-members can run with us, but must agree to the waiver on our

          We love to eat just as much as we love to run (or more)!
          After most Saturday runs, we organize a group to try brunch at nearby places.&rdquo;

          Celebrate the end of each month with our Run Club Socials!
          On the last Saturday of each month, our club members bring food and drink to share.
          These gatherings are a fantastic way to connect with other members over
          homemade goodies, fruits, and refreshing beverages, provided by the club!

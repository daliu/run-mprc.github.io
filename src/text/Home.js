  "Welcome to the Mid-Peninsula Running Club, where running is more than just a workout – it's a community and a way of life. Since 1988, we've been bringing together runners from all walks of life on the San Francisco Peninsula (San Mateo County).",
  "Our club isn't just about hitting the pavement; it's about forging connections and enjoying the outdoors. Picture a group of around 150 friendly locals who share a love for staying active and appreciating the beauty of nature.",
  "Every Saturday morning at 8:45 AM, we have our main run/walk on the Bay Trail in San Mateo. You can choose to run/walk any distance from 4-6 miles. It's a great way to start the weekend! We also have special events just for our members throughout the year, giving us more chances to have fun together.",
  "Come and join us! We're all about running, making friends, and having a good time.",

  'Now, we\'ve got this informal motto about ourselves too, that we are : "an eating club with a running problem". We get it – we love our post-run snacks as much as the run itself!',
  "So, our mission? Pairing you up with a run or walk buddy because we believe in the power of running side by side. It's not just about the miles; it's about the friendships, the shared laughs, and, yes, the good eats.",
  "Join us in celebrating the joy of running and in our mission of supporting one another. Let's hit the trails, share some stories, and enjoy the ride – one step at a time!",
